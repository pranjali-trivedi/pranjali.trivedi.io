								<h3><center>December, 2019<br><strong>FOOD MALL SYSTEM</strong></center></h3>
								<p>There is foodmall system in VIT but it is not much efficient. With the increasing number of students the staff of the
									 mess is unable to clear the queue in time or deliver the orders on time; sometimes the staff takes wrong order. Our
									  project enables the student to order any kind of food from the mess and the staff can check the balance on the student ID.</p>

								<h3><center>December, 2018<br><strong>INDOOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM</strong></center></h3>
								<p>Navigation entails the continuous tracking of the user’s position and his surroundings for the purpose of dynamically
									 planning and following a route to the user’s intended destination. The Global Positioning System (GPS) made the task 
									 of navigating outdoors relatively straightforward, but due to the lack of signal reception inside buildings, navigating
									  indoors has become a very challenging task.</p>
